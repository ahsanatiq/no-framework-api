        "name": "Garlic Herb Butter Steak",
        "description": "Ever wanted to make a steakhouse-quality meal in your own kitchen but weren’t sure where to start? We’ve got the ingredients and recipe for you; all you have to do is bring it to life. Start by roasting sweet and Yukon gold potato wedges in the oven. While those spuds get toasty and crisp, you can easily sizzle the sirloin steak and mini bell pepper jumble in a pan. The beef is then finished with a flavorful garlic herb butter that’ll knock everyone’s socks off. Yes, my friend, that dinner was all you."

        "name": "Blackened Chicken Penne",
        "description": "This pasta may break the rules, but it does so deliciously: instead of going the traditional Italian route, our chefs opted to mix things up with a jumble of Southwestern flavors. The pre-cut chicken strips get seasoned with blackening seasoning and are tossed in the pan until they're perfectly smoky and savory. Some poblano pepper and diced tomato add texture and more unconventional flair, while the Monterey Jack cheese sauce brings supreme creaminess to the penne."

        "name": "Mediterranean Baked Veggies",
        "description": "We don’t mean to burst tomatoes’ bubble, but when you literally burst tomatoes in the oven, they become all the more delicious. And while we hate to imagine them straining, seizing, and shriveling under that sizzling heat, they come out on the other side with a flavor that’s concentrated and juicy. It allows them to hold their own against the assertive flavors in this dish, from briny feta cheese to grassy green asparagus."

        "name": "Harissa Sweet Potato Pita Pockets",
        "description": "All hail the pita! It holds pretty much anything you put in its roomy pockets, making it among the most capacious of breads. So if you’re going to make a pita sandwich, it better be fully loaded. This one does not disappoint: in addition to rounds of roasted sweet potato, it’s packed with slices of creamy avocado, an herby cucumber salad, pine nuts, and a spicy harissa mayo."
